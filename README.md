| Setting       | Description                                                                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`     | Specifies the name of the application. This name will be used by other micro frontend applications.   |
| `port`     | Specifies the port number on which the application will run. It should be unique to avoid conflicts with other micro frontend applications. |
| `filename` | Specifies the name of the file to be exposed by the application. Other micro frontend applications can use this file to access components. |
| `exposes`  | An object that defines the components that can be used by other micro frontend applications. Each component is specified with a key and the corresponding file path. |

```javascript
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'microReactComponent',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './Component': './src/Component',
  },
}),
```
